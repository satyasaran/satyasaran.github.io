I am [Satyasaran Changdar](https://di.ku.dk/english/staff/vip/?pure=en/persons/723168), Postdoc in Machine Learning, [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/) under the Supervisons of [Dr. Erik Bjørnager Dam](https://di.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/93620), Professor, [Department of Computer Science](https://di.ku.dk/english/), University of Copenhagen and [Dr. Kristian Thorup-Kristensen](https://plen.ku.dk/english/employees/?pure=en/persons/143157)
Professor, [Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences](https://plen.ku.dk/english/), University of Copenhagen, Denmark
 and completed my Ph.D. in applied mathematics in 2019 at [University of Calcutta](https://www.caluniv.ac.in), master of technology in computer applications from [Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in), India in 2008 and masters in mathematics at [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](www.iitb.ac.in), India in 2005. 
Before joining Postdoc, I was working as an associate professor in [Institute of engineering and Management](https://iem.edu.in), Kolkata, India.

I specialize in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Physics-informed Machine Learning, and Data-driven Scientific Computing. I have been actively involved in the development of machine learning methods that extract patterns from multimodal agriculture data in crop science from [RadiMax](https://cropinnovation.dk/some-of-the-projects/radimax/) in  [RadiBooster project](https://plen.ku.dk/english/research/crop_sciences/cpps/radibooster/). 

I have been collaborating with my PhD supervisor [Dr. Soumen De](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=ZwIi7oUAAAAJ&hl=en) and supervising Phd Students [Bivas Bhaumik](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FfG_kKQAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=3) and [Susmita Saha](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Susmita-Saha-16) in University of Calcutta, India.

# Projects

## Project 1: Deep Learning for sub-soil Image analysis to investigate deep root fuction 

In Project 1, our objective was to employ deep learning techniques to analyze sub-soil images and investigate the function of deep roots in plant physiology. Specifically, we utilized transfer learning with the ResNet50 architecture to develop regression models for root length estimation and root classification and root function models


### Results
